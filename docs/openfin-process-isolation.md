## TL;DR (as originally written — outcome superseded by the notice above)

Every OpenFin platform view now gets its **own Chromium renderer process**,
enforced by stamping a **unique `processAffinity`** per view in the platform
override. Before this change, all same-origin views — ten 20k-row streaming
blotters included — shared **one renderer process and one main thread**.
Measured result with ~11 blotters on one machine:

| | Before (shared renderer) | After (isolated) |
|---|---|---|
| Blotter renderer processes | **1** × 4,705 MB | **~11** × ~200 MB |
| Blotter renderer CPU | 6.2% total = **one core saturated**, all views queued on it | 0.5–0.7% **each**, main threads ~90% idle |
| Total OpenFin memory | 5,566 MB | **3,120 MB (−2.4 GB)** |
| Interaction | fleet-wide sluggish typing/clicking/scrolling | crisp |

Total memory went **down**, not up: one giant V8 heap under constant
allocation pressure from ten grids fragments and defers GC; ten small
heaps each collect cheaply and stay compact.

## The diagnostic signature (worth remembering)

The fleet was sluggish while Task Manager showed only **~32% total CPU** —
which repeatedly (mis)read as "the machine has headroom, so the app is
slow". The tell: **sluggish UI at low aggregate CPU means individual
threads are saturated while the rest of the chip idles.** On a 16-thread
machine, one fully pegged core reads as just **6.25%** aggregate. The
Processes view made it unambiguous: one OpenFin process at 4.7 GB / 6.2%
CPU (= exactly one core), while ten blotters were open and no other
process was doing meaningful work. Ten grids' decode, React, AG Grid
apply, and paint were all queuing on a single main thread.

Per-process Task Manager (or `chrome://inspect` → per-target Performance
trace) localizes this in seconds; aggregate CPU graphs never will.

## Root cause

Two stacked causes:

1. **Chromium groups same-origin content into a shared renderer process.**
   Every platform view here is served from one origin (one Vite app), so
   by default OpenFin packs all of them into one renderer. OpenFin's
   `processAffinity` view option makes the grouping explicit: views with
   the **same affinity string share one renderer process**.
2. **The star-demo seed made it worse** by explicitly pinning
   `"processAffinity": "star-demo"` on its views — and every duplicated
   page/tab carried that pin along, guaranteeing the single-process fleet
   no matter how many blotters the user opened.

A third, compounding factor: **Windows 11 EcoQoS** stamped the one
overloaded renderer "Efficiency mode" — scheduling it on efficiency cores
at reduced priority — throttling the very process doing all the work.

## The fix

### 1. Unique affinity per view, stamped centrally

[`viewProcessIsolation.ts`](../packages/openfin/openfin-platform/src/viewProcessIsolation.ts):

```ts
export function ensureViewProcessIsolation(opts) {
  opts.processAffinity = opts.name
    ? `view-iso-${opts.name}`      // stable: restored views return to their process
    : generateAffinityKey();       // "view-iso-<uuid>" for nameless creations
  return opts;
}

export function isolateLayoutViews(layout) { /* recursive walk, see below */ }
```

Design decisions:

- **The view `name` is the affinity key** when present. Names are stable
  across snapshot save/restore, so a restored view returns to *its own*
  process instead of minting an unbounded set of affinity strings.
- **Caller-supplied affinities are REPLACED**, not respected — a shared
  inbound affinity (the seed's legacy `"star-demo"`, re-imported through
  every page duplication) is precisely the bug this exists to fix.
- A static `defaultViewOptions.processAffinity` in the manifest **cannot**
  express this: one static string = one shared group = the exact bug.
  Uniqueness requires code at creation time.

### 2. Wired into the platform override — both creation paths

[`workspacePersistence.ts`](../packages/openfin/openfin-platform/src/workspacePersistence.ts)
(`MarketsUIWorkspaceProvider`, the `overrideCallback` every consumer of
`initWorkspace()` already uses):

```ts
async createView(payload, callerIdentity) {
  if (payload?.opts) ensureViewProcessIsolation(payload.opts);
  return super.createView(payload, callerIdentity);
}

async createWindow(payload, identity) {
  isolateLayoutViews(payload?.layout);
  isolateLayoutViews(payload?.windowOptions?.layout);
  return super.createWindow(payload, identity);
}
```

Why both hooks:

| Path | Covered by |
|---|---|
| Browser "+" tab, page duplication, dock component launches | `createView` |
| Workspace restore / seed import — views arrive **embedded in the window's layout tree**, not as per-view `createView` calls | `createWindow` + `isolateLayoutViews` walking the golden-layout tree and stamping every view `componentState` |

Because this lives in the shared `openfin-platform` provider, **every app
using `initWorkspace()`** (star-demo, markets-ui-react-reference, …) gets
isolation with no app-side change.

### 3. Seed hardening (defense in depth)

[`apps/demos/star-demo/public/seed.json`](../apps/demos/star-demo/public/seed.json):
the three `"processAffinity": "star-demo"` pins became distinct
`view-iso-seed-1/2/3` values. The `createWindow` walker replaces them at
restore anyway; the seed just no longer encodes the bug if some future
path bypasses the override.

### 4. EcoQoS disabled for background renderers

[`apps/demos/star-demo/public/platform/manifest.fin.json`](../apps/demos/star-demo/public/platform/manifest.fin.json):

```
--disable-features=UseEcoQoSForBackgroundProcess
```

Background blotters are live trading views that must keep consuming their
stream at full speed; Windows demoting them to efficiency-core scheduling
is the wrong policy for this workload. (This is per-manifest — other apps
opt in by adding the same runtime argument.)

## What is deliberately NOT isolated

**Child tool windows and popouts** (`fin.Window.create` — see
[`popoutWindow.ts`](../packages/openfin/host-openfin/src/popoutWindow.ts))
keep OpenFin's default process grouping. The React-portal popout pattern
requires same-process DOM access (`getWebWindow()`), which default
grouping provides and an affinity would break — that file documents the
history. **Smoke test after any affinity change:** pop out the customizer
drawer; if it ever renders blank, derive the popout's affinity from its
caller instead.

## Operational notes for multi-window perf work

- **Never perf-test multi-window on the Vite dev server.** Dev mode serves
  hundreds of unminified modules per view from a single process; the first
  navigate after code changes also pays dependency re-optimization
  (observed: 61 s `createView::navigate`). Use the built app:
  `npm run build:apps`, then `preview` + `client` in the app.
- **Fully close the platform after worker code changes.** The SharedWorker
  outlives windows; new client code attached to a stale worker sends RPCs
  the old worker silently drops (e.g. `provider-running`), hanging grid
  wiring forever.
- **Watch the one remaining busy process** as blotter count grows: the
  OpenFin browser process (compositing) or the SharedWorker host (hub
  fan-out). If it approaches one full core (6.25% aggregate on 16
  threads), inspect via the manifest's `devtools_port` and escalate — the
  parked design for a saturated hub thread is an ingest worker with
  transferable hand-off, **not** per-window WebSockets (those multiply
  upstream parse per window and move it onto the contended main threads).
- **Memory per additional blotter** is now ~200 MB (own renderer). Budget
  accordingly; commit-charge pressure amplifies everything.
