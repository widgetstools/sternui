 * the whole app, and returns the bundle as a `DataServices` object.
 *
 * Idempotent by `appName`. Same `appName` → same object reference,
 * so two parts of the app booting independently still share one
 * client + one mirror.
 *
 * The caller constructs the `SharedWorker` because Vite's worker
 * plugin requires the literal

 * at the call site (static analysis emits the worker chunk and
 * rewrites the URL). Bootstrap can't construct it itself without
 * defeating that.
