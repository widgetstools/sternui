/**
 * The mock book delivered through a Perspective Table.
 *
 * Stands to `startMock` exactly as `stompPerspective` stands to `startStomp`,
 * and for the same reason: the generator, the tick behaviour and the restart
 * semantics all stay in ONE place, and the Table is a side effect of the emit
 * stream rather than a replacement for it. The classic push path is forwarded
 * synchronously and unmodified, so anything already subscribed to this
 * provider keeps working exactly as before.
 *
 * It exists so the Perspective row engine can be driven against a book an app
 * already understands, with no broker to stand up. That is what makes a
 * Perspective app and its CSRM twin a real A/B pair — same columns, same
 * profiles, same scenarios — so a difference between them is the engine and
 * nothing else. Without it the only Table-holding provider is
 * `stomp-perspective`, which brings its own dataset and makes every comparison
 * ambiguous between the engine and the data.
 *
 * **`rowShape` defaults to `'ssrm'` here, unlike `mock`.** A Perspective schema
 * is a flat map of typed columns, and the mock positions row is deeply nested
 * (ratings, key-rate durations, exposure breakdowns). Emitting it unflattened
 * would hand the feed nested objects, which `observeRows` reports as `nested`
 * and drops — a Table with a fraction of its columns and no error anywhere.
 * The flatten needs `columnDefinitions`, so a config without them is refused
 * loudly rather than served short.
