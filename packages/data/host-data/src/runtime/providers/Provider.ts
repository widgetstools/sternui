/**
 * Provider primitive — three free functions, no class hierarchy.
 *
 * The Hub owns the cache; providers just emit. Three event shapes:
 *
 *   • `{ rows, replace? }` — keyed upserts (or full reset on restart).
 *     Hub merges into its cache by `cfg.keyColumn` then broadcasts.
 *   • `{ status, error? }` — lifecycle transition (loading → ready →
 *     error). Hub stashes + broadcasts.
 *   • `{ byteSize }` — increment the stats byte counter without
 *     emitting a row event. Lets providers track raw frame size for
 *     bandwidth monitoring even on no-op messages (heartbeats, end
 *     tokens, etc.).
 *   • `{ rowsReceived }` — cumulative in-flight snapshot row count
 *     while the hub cache is still empty (STOMP snapshot buffer).
 *     Hub fans this out as wire `rows-received` events so consumers
 *     can drive loading overlays before the first chunked delta.
 *   • `{ timing }` — connection-latency samples for the diagnostics
 *     pane: `requestSentMs` (Restart click → upstream request sent)
 *     and `firstMessageMs` (request sent → first upstream message).
 *     Either field is optional; the Hub stores whichever is present.
 *
 * Keeping these as plain functions has two upsides over a Provider
 * class:
 *   1. There's no `state` object to leak through the contract — the
 *      Hub's cache is the single source of truth.
 *   2. Adding a new transport is one file with one function, no
 *      base class to extend.
