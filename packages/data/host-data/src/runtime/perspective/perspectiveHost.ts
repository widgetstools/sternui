/**
 * Host the Perspective engine and its Tables inside a worker.
 *
 * One engine and one Table per provider serve every blotter window: a window
 * opens a View against a Table it did not create and reads only the rows its
 * viewport asks for, instead of being sent the whole book. That is the entire
 * point of the pull path.
 *
 * Roles, forced by the runtime and proven end to end in
 * `packages/react-grid/perspective-grid/harness/`:
 *
 *   here (worker)   perspective.worker()          -> the host Client, owns the Tables
 *                   client.new_proxy_session(cb)  -> one per attached window
 *                   session.handle_request(frame) <- frames from that window
 *
 *   there (window)  perspective.worker(port)      -> that window's Client
 *                   client.open_table(name)       -> Table -> View
 *
 * `loadPerspective` is INJECTED rather than imported. The inline build carries
 * its wasm as base64 and the worker asset is a single esbuild bundle that every
 * app loads, so importing it here statically would add megabytes to workers
 * that never open a blotter. Injection keeps the cost with the entry that opts
 * in — and makes this module testable without a wasm engine.
