/**
 * Deletion-safe wrapper around a Perspective View.
 *
 * MEASURED on @perspective-dev/client 4.5.2 (`scripts/deleteRaceProbe.mjs`):
 * calling `view.delete()` while a `to_columns()` read is in flight throws
 *
 *     Error: attempted to take ownership of Rust value while it was borrowed
 *
 * from inside a wasm-futures microtask. This is NOT catchable by the caller —
 * neither `try/await/catch` around the read nor `.catch()` on the delete
 * intercepts it; in Node it terminated the process outright. The same defect
 * was present in @finos/perspective 3.8 and survives into 4.5.2.
 *
 * The Table lives in the SharedWorker, so an uncatchable throw there can take
 * the worker down and with it every blotter. AG Grid swaps Views on every
 * sort/filter change while blocks are still in flight, so this is a routine
 * path, not an edge case.
 *
 * The rule this enforces: a View is deleted only once its in-flight reads
 * have drained. `close()` is therefore asynchronous and idempotent; reads
 * attempted after close resolve to `null` so the datasource can settle the
 * block EMPTY rather than leaking an AG Grid request (see
 * `createPerspectiveDatasource`, rule 1).
