/**
 * AG Grid server-side datasource backed by a Perspective View.
 *
 * The book lives once as a Table in the SharedWorker; this datasource
 * serves the blocks AG Grid asks for by reading a window out of a View.
 * Measured on 4.5.2, a 100-row window read is ~2-6ms and is FLAT with
 * scroll depth — which is the whole reason for the engine swap. CSRM
 * has to materialize all 20k rows x 52 columns in every window.
 *
 * The rules encoded below come from decoding the shipped ag-grid-enterprise
 * 36.0.0 bundle; the public docs are silent on all of them, and violating
 * any one fails SILENTLY rather than throwing.
