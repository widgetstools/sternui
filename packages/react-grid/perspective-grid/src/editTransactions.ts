/**
 * Turn an AG Grid data transaction into Table edits.
 *
 * The editing modules — smart edit, bulk update, and undo/redo in the
 * data-change-history panel — do not write through the cell editor. They build
 * a patch list and hand it to `GridPlatform.applyDataTransaction` as a
 * transaction of FULL ROW objects. On the client-side row model that lands
 * directly in the row store; under the server row model
 * `GridApi.applyTransactionAsync` is not the write path at all, and the book
 * lives in the worker regardless.
 *
 * MEASURED, and the reason this module exists: with nothing mapping that
 * transaction, smart edit on the Perspective surface reported the right cell
 * count, enabled its buttons, ran its handler and changed NOTHING. The same
 * flow on the CSRM twin, same column, same operand, doubled the value —
 * 4,215,482 → 8,430,964 against 30,053,717 → 30,053,717.
 *
 * Two rules the naive mapping gets wrong:
 *
 *   - **Only CHANGED fields may be written.** A transaction row is the whole
 *     row, rebuilt from the node's current data with the patched fields
 *     overwritten. Upserting all of it would write back this window's copy of
 *     every OTHER column — including the ones the live feed is sweeping — so a
 *     one-cell edit would resurrect stale prices for every peer window reading
 *     the same Table. Diffing against the node is what keeps an edit an edit.
 *   - **`add` and `remove` are ignored.** Membership of the book belongs to the
 *     provider that fills the Table, not to an editing module in one window.
 *     Deleting a row here would delete it for every blotter on the desk, and it
 *     would return on the next snapshot anyway.
