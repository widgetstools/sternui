/**
 * Load the Perspective client a blotter window needs — WITHOUT the 5 MB build.
 *
 * A window on this path never runs the engine. The engine and the book live in
 * the SharedWorker; this window holds a Client that proxies to it. Yet every
 * window was importing `@perspective-dev/client/inline`, which carries BOTH
 * wasm binaries base64-encoded in a single 5,070 kB JS chunk — including the
 * 2,406 kB server binary it can never execute. MEASURED across three windows:
 * ~900 ms of every window's ~1.1 s open is that chunk booting, against
 * 191–315 ms for everything the row engine does.
 *
 * So this loads the slim 47.70 kB build and points it at the client wasm as a
 * separate, cacheable 521 kB asset.
 *
 * ## Why not share the compiled module from the worker
 *
 * The vendor documents `getCompiledClientWasm()` for exactly this, and it was
 * tried first. It does not work here, for a reason no amount of plumbing fixes
 * — MEASURED in `harness/wasmshare.html`:
 *
 *   - `getCompiledClientWasm()` works fine in a SharedWorker: 0.2 ms, 103
 *     exports, once a client exists in that scope. (It throws in ~2 ms before
 *     one does, which is what the first attempt actually hit — a rejection
 *     that fast loses no race with a 1.5 s timeout, it settles first. The
 *     earlier "it blocks the worker's event loop" reading was wrong.)
 *   - **The Module cannot leave a SharedWorker.** `postMessage` does not
 *     throw; the receiving window raises `messageerror` and the value never
 *     arrives. A `WebAssembly.Module` is structured-cloneable but may not be
 *     deserialized in another agent cluster, and a SharedWorker is its own.
 *     (A dedicated Worker shares its owner's cluster — which is why an earlier
 *     round trip through one succeeded and proved less than it looked like.)
 *
 * Fetching the wasm needs no transfer at all, so the agent-cluster rule is
 * simply not in the picture. MEASURED, same page, both reading 20,000 rows
 * from the worker-held Table: inline 4,951.84 kB and 178.2 ms; this 555.67 kB
 * and 36.3 ms. The wasm is then an ordinary HTTP-cached asset, so windows
 * 2..N pay for neither the bytes nor, on browsers with a compiled-wasm cache,
 * the compile.
