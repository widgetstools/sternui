/**
 * Restores real DOM focus to the grid's focused cell when the window
 * regains OS focus (alt-tab back).
 *
 * Chromium keeps `document.activeElement` on the cell across a window
 * blur, so after alt-tab-return paste/typing works immediately in a
 * plain browser tab. Inside an OpenFin window the runtime's view focus
 * handling breaks that in two ways:
 *
 *  1. The view regains web-contents focus but the active element is
 *     dropped to `<body>` — sometimes AFTER the DOM `focus` event, so a
 *     one-shot check misses it. Countered with a short retry schedule.
 *  2. The OS window re-activates but NO view regains web-contents
 *     focus, so the view's DOM `window` never fires `focus` at all.
 *     Countered by also subscribing to the parent OpenFin window's
 *     `focused` event (via @starui/host-openfin; noop in a browser) and
 *     handing web-contents focus back with `fin.me.focus()` before
 *     re-focusing the cell.
 *
 * In both cases AG Grid still paints the focus ring (its focused-cell
 * state is CSS-driven, not activeElement-driven) while Ctrl+V and
 * keystrokes route nowhere until the user clicks — this hook re-asserts
 * browser focus on the cell AG Grid still reports as focused via
 * `api.setFocusedCell`.
 *
 * Guards (all must pass before focus is touched):
 *  - This grid owned DOM focus when the window blurred — tracked via
 *    focusin/focusout on the grid surface, so two grids in one document
 *    never fight over restoration.
 *  - This DOCUMENT was the fleet's most recently focused one — tracked
 *    via a localStorage stamp (same-origin OpenFin views share
 *    localStorage), so two blotter views in one window never steal
 *    web-contents focus from each other.
 *  - Focus fell to `<body>`/`<html>` or somewhere inside this grid
 *    that isn't a cell. If the user (or the browser's own restoration)
 *    put focus on any element outside the grid, never steal it.
 *  - No cell editor is open — forcing cell focus would pull focus off
 *    the editor input.
