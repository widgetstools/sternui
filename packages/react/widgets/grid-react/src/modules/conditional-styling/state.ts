 * mount time, NOT inline styles — keeps re-render cheap and lets the dark
 * theme switch via `:root.dark` selectors without recomputing rules.

 * Optional "flash on match" config for a rule.

 * Implementation note: this is a **CSS-keyframes** flash rendered through
 * the rule's own injected class — NOT AG-Grid's native `api.flashCells()`.
 * That choice is deliberate (see `transforms.ts`):
 *   - lets us paint header surfaces (AG-Grid has no `headerClassRules`);
 *   - gives each rule its own colour + timing instead of one global theme
 *     param;
 *   - composes naturally with `activeDurationMs` (class drop = animation
 *     stop, no double-timer coordination);
 *   - zero per-cell JS cost — the GPU drives the animation.
 *
 * Each rule emits its own animation name (`ds-flash-<ruleId>`) and its
 * own scoped `--ds-flash-color` variable, so two flashing rules on the
 * same cell stay visually independent. When more than one flash rule
 * matches, the higher-priority rule wins the cascade (predictable, not a
 * blended chaos).
 *
 * `target` is constrained by the rule's `scope`:
 *   - `scope.type === 'row'`   → only `'row'` makes sense.
 *   - `scope.type === 'cell'`  → `'cells'`, `'headers'`, or `'cells+headers'`.
 *
 * The runtime validates the combination defensively (defaults to the
 * scope-appropriate choice when a legacy/invalid value is loaded).
