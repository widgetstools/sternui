/**
 * Workspace-membership-driven GC for orphaned per-instance config rows.

 * │  Repeated false-positive deletions (registry scope mismatches,   │
 * │  pre-flag rows, race conditions on first save) made this sweep   │
 * │  unsafe to leave armed. The sweep still RUNS and still computes  │

 *
 * The intended rule (when re-enabled): per-instance clones are ephemeral
 * until claimed by a saved workspace; everything that represents a
 * registered component (singleton row, non-singleton template) is
 * permanent and never reaped.
 *
 * Preservation rules (any one is enough to keep a row):
 *   1. componentType === 'workspace'           — workspace rows themselves
 *   2. isTemplate === true                     — admin-defined templates
 *   3. isRegisteredComponent === true          — explicit flag set when the
 *                                                row was written as a
 *                                                registered-component config
 *   4. configId in WELL_KNOWN_SHARED_IDS       — admin/system rows
 *                                                (dock, registry, ws-setup)
 *   5. configId === deriveSingletonConfigId(componentType, componentSubType)
 *                                              — self-describing fallback for
 *                                                pre-flag rows; protects existing
 *                                                singleton rows that haven't
 *                                                been re-saved yet
 *   6. configId in singletonKeys (registry)    — entry-driven catch for
 *                                                custom configIds that don't
 *                                                match the canonical derivation
 *   7. configId referenced by some saved workspace's instanceIds
 *
 * Rules 3, 5, and 6 are layered defenses for the same intent — "registered
 * components are protected." The explicit flag (rule 3) is the canonical
 * signal going forward; rules 5–6 catch legacy rows and registries written
 * under unusual scopes.
 *
 * GC is wired to:
 *   • createSavedWorkspace / updateSavedWorkspace / deleteSavedWorkspace
 *     (via onWorkspaceChange in workspace-persistence.ts)
 *   • app start (via initWorkspace bootstrap)
