// ─── Host URL resolution ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// OpenFin's `platform.createView({url})` and `fin.Window.create({url})`
// run in the OpenFin runtime process and have no implicit base URL —
// they require an absolute URL. The Registry stores `hostUrl` as the
// user typed it (could be an absolute `https://…` or a host-relative
// path like `/blotters/marketsgrid`). Normalising at launch time, not
// at registry-write time, keeps registries portable: an entry written
// on `localhost:5174` resolves correctly when imported on prod.
//
// Lives in its own file (no top-level workspace-platform imports) so
// the side-effect-free `@marketsui/openfin-platform/config` subpath
// can re-export it for in-browser consumers like the registry editor.

/**
 * Normalise a registry `hostUrl` into an absolute URL OpenFin will
 * accept.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   • Already-absolute (`http://`, `https://`, `file://`, `data:`,
 *     etc.) — returned unchanged.
 *   • Starts with `//` — protocol-relative, resolved against
 *     `window.location.href` (gets the current protocol).
 *   • Starts with `/` — host-relative path, resolved against
 *     `window.location.href` (gets origin).
 *   • Anything else (bare relative like `views/foo`) — also resolved
 *     against `window.location.href`, so it behaves like an `<a href>`.
 *
 * Returns the input unchanged when `window` isn't available (Node /
 * SSR contexts), since there's no origin to graft onto.
